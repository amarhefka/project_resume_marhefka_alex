## Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this assignment and in the syllabus.

## Comments
There's an error in the Unicorn validator regarding a stray <script> tag after </body>, but it's not actually present in my HTML file. The error seems to be related to my web host, as I don't receive it when I validate my index.html via file upload.

Note that I had to use a slightly older version of jQuery (2.2.4) because the jQuery.scrolling plugin wasn't working with the most recent version.

The custom jQuery I wrote for this project is at the end of the main.js file (on lines 14â€“17). It allows the user to click on the subheadings/tabs (e.g., Education) to expand or collapse that section.
